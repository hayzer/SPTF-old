SPTF version 0.01
=================

DESCRIPTION

SPTF is a framework for tests management and execution.
Most testing framework that I know does not combine those two
different tasks. Either you can only execute the tests with
more or less control over this process, or you can manage
somehow the information about the tests without the ability to
execute them.
SPTF is a single application to rule them both, to bring them
both and in the darkness to bind them.

INSTALLATION

To install this software, just open the SPTF compressed archive.

USAGE

# ./sptf --help

For more info read SPTF wiki.

EXAMPLE

There is a very short example of how the test case/scenario
may look like. 
You may start with the follow commands:

# ./sptf --show-summary --all-scenarios

# ./sptf --show-tc-summary --scenario-id 1

# ./sptf --run --scenario-id 1

This should give you a basic idea what the SPTF is about.
Next versions will include more sophisticated examples.

DEPENDENCIES

I do my best to have as few as possible. Thus I do have some.

* Perl interpreter (I guess, versions 5.8.5 and higher are good enough)

The follow Perl modules:
* Carp - should be part of your Perl core installation
* YAML - as above (and if not, let me know)
* Getopt::Long - as above
* Test::More   - as above
* Test::Builder - it's not the part of the Perl core installation.
                  You should install it from CPAN or with the help of
				  your distribution packaging system
				  
* Time::Elapse - it's not the Perl core module, but it's not mandatory.
                 SPTF can work without it. Without this you won't see
				 the total time of the test.

* Text::ASCIITable - as above. If available, all show options are 
                     printed within nice ASCII tables.
